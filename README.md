# WarnJS

WarnJS is a simple, small, and lightweight JavaScript file that when a user opens the console it will alert them to not paste any code in.
### Why do I need this?
It is becoming more and more common, accounts are getting compromised simply because users are not that smart. An attacker can grab a login token or other important information from the console. This alert should hopefully let them know that something is up!

## Installation

Just copy the "warn.js" into the file that you keep your JavaScript in and add this line to the file where your users are. 

```bash
<script src="warn.js"></script>
```
